Your task is to create new agent trajectories based on existing examples.\n\n## SIMULATOR_MODE: strict\nYou are operating in STRICT simulator mode.\n- Treat tools as strict APIs. Do NOT repair or infer missing/invalid arguments.\n- If a tool call is invalid (wrong tool, missing required args, wrong arg types/format), the OBSERVATION MUST be an explicit error with a concrete reason.\n- If the assistant attempts an action that violates any policy or constraint in the example style, the outcome MUST be a denial/failure (no success).\n- When returning errors, include a brief reason + the minimal fix needed.\n\n## Example Trajectory:\nSYSTEM: <instructions>\nYou are a customer service agent that helps the user according to the <policy> provided below.\nIn each turn you can either:\n- Send a message to the user.\n- Make a tool call.\nYou cannot do both at the same time.\n\n</instructions>\n<policy>\n# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users:\n\n- **cancel or modify pending orders**\n- **return or exchange delivered orders**\n- **modify their default user address**\n- **provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products**\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\nOnce the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\nYou can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\nBefore taking any action that updates the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided by the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n### User\n\nEach user has a profile containing:\n\n- unique user id\n- email\n- default address\n- payment methods.\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **gift card**, **paypal account**, **credit card**.\n\n### Product\n\nOur retail store has 50 types of products.\n\nFor each **type of product**, there are **variant items** of different **options**.\n\nFor example, for a 't-shirt' product, there could be a variant item with option 'color blue size M', and another variant item with option 'color red size L'.\n\nEach product has the following attributes:\n\n- unique product id\n- name\n- list of variants\n\nEach variant item has the following attributes:\n\n- unique item id\n- information about the value of the product options for this item.\n- availability\n- price\n\nNote: Product ID and Item ID have no relations and should not be confused!\n\n### Order\n\nEach order has the following attributes:\n\n- unique order id\n- user id\n- address\n- items ordered\n- status\n- fullfilments info (tracking id and item ids)\n- payment history\n\nThe status of an order can be: **pending**, **processed**, **delivered**, or **cancelled**.\n\nOrders can have other optional attributes based on the actions that have been taken (cancellation reason, which items have been exchanged, what was the exchane price difference etc)\n\n## Generic action rules\n\nGenerally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\nExchange or modify order tools can only be called once per order. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\nAn order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation. Other reasons are not acceptable.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\nAn order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nFor a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\nThe user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\nIf the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be kept as 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise it will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\nThis action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)'. The agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So you must confirm all the details are correct and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all the items they want to modify.\n\nFor a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\nAn order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the list of items to be returned.\n\nThe user needs to provide a payment method to receive the refund.\n\nThe refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\nAn order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\nFor a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items. There is no need to place a new order.\n\n</policy>\n\n# Tools\n\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\n\n<tools>\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"description\": \"The mathematical expression to calculate, such as '2 + 2'.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to let me know.\n\nThank you for choosing our store!\n\n## Available Tools:\n- calculate: Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\n- cancel_pending_order: Cancel a pending order. If the order is already processed or delivered,\n\nit cannot be cancelled. The agent needs to explain the cancellation detail\nand ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed. If the user confirms,\nthe order status will be changed to 'cancelled' and the payment will be refunded.\nThe refund will be added to the user's gift card balance immediately if the payment\nwas made using a gift card, otherwise the refund would take 5-7 business days to process.\nThe function returns the order details after the cancellation.\n- exchange_delivered_order_items: Exchange items in a delivered order to new items of the same product type.\n\nFor a delivered order, return or exchange can be only done once by the agent.\nThe agent needs to explain the exchange detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- find_user_id_by_name_zip: Find user id by first name, last name, and zip code. If the user is not found, the function\n\nwill return an error message. By default, find user id by email, and only call this function\nif the user is not found by email or cannot remember email.\n- find_user_id_by_email: Find user id by email. If the user is not found, the function will return an error message.\n- get_order_details: Get the status and details of an order.\n- get_product_details: Get the inventory details of a product.\n- get_user_details: Get the details of a user, including their orders.\n- list_all_product_types: List the name and product id of all product types.\n\nEach product type has a variety of different items with unique item ids and options.\nThere are only 50 product types in the store.\n- modify_pending_order_address: Modify the shipping address of a pending order. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_items: Modify items in a pending order to new items of the same product type. For a pending order, this function can only be called once. The agent needs to explain the exchange detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_payment: Modify the payment method of a pending order. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_user_address: Modify the default address of a user. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- return_delivered_order_items: Return some items of a delivered order.\n\nThe order status will be changed to 'return requested'.\nThe agent needs to explain the return detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\nThe user will receive follow-up email for how and where to return the item.\n- transfer_to_human_agents: Transfer the user to a human agent, with a summary of the user's issue.\n\nOnly transfer if\n -  the user explicitly asks for a human agent\n -  given the policy and the available tools, you cannot solve the user's issue.\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **STRICTLY PRESERVE ORIGINAL FORMAT**: You MUST maintain the EXACT format structure from the example trajectory (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed)\n2. **NO SYSTEM PROMPT GENERATION**: Do NOT generate any SYSTEM messages - follow the system prompt from the original example and that will be preserved separately\n3. **TOOL CONSTRAINT ADHERENCE**: You MUST STRICTLY use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above. DO NOT use any tools outside this specified allowed tool set. This is MANDATORY.\n4. **FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: Maintain identical conversation structure, role naming conventions, and response patterns as shown in the example (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added)\n5. **TURN COUNT MATCHING**: Generate approximately the SAME NUMBER of conversation turns as the example trajectory - the generated conversation should have a comparable length and depth to the sample data\n\n## CRITICAL RETAIL COMPLIANCE RULES:\n1. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE KEY NUMBERS**: State final total price, refund amount, tracking numbers, and price differences explicitly to user\n2. **ORDER STATUS MATCHING**: Use pending tools for pending orders, delivered tools for delivered orders - NEVER mix them\n3. **ID FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: When generating IDs (order IDs, item IDs, payment method IDs, user IDs), carefully observe the format and pattern used in the example trajectory and generat IDs that follow the same style. Avoid obvious fake patterns like \"112233\", \"123456\", etc. Use varied, realistic-looking combinations similar to those in the sample.\n\n## FUNCTION_CALL TURN REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **REASONING IN THINK TAGS**: When making function calls, add brief reasoning (1-3 sentences) inside `<think> </think>` tags ONLY in FUNCTION_CALL turns after you output 'FUNCTION_CALL:'\n2. **SELECTIVE REASONING**: Not every function call needs reasoning. Only include it when it helps explain the complex decision-making process\n3. **STRICT TURN CONSTRAINT**: Reasoning in `<think> </think>` tags should ONLY appear in FUNCTION_CALL turns, NEVER in HUMAN, GPT, OBSERRVATION or additional turns\n4. **FORMAT REQUIREMENT**: If reasoning is included, the FUNCTION_CALL turn are allowed to add the thinking sentences instead of only JSON format. You should follow this format:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION_CALL:\n   <think>\n   Brief reasoning about why this function call is needed (1-3 sentences). Ended with: I will call the function <function_name>.\n   </think>\n   {\"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": {...}}\n   ```\n\n\n## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:\n- DO NOT use ANY tools that are not explicitly listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above\n- DO NOT change the conversation format structure (human/gpt roles, value formatting, etc.) - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed\n- DO NOT violate any fixed formatting elements, tool specifications, or requirements in system instructions from the example - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added\n- DO NOT generate significantly fewer or more turns than the example trajectory\n- DO NOT invent or create new tools - use ONLY the provided tools\n\n## Requirements:\n1. Generate a completely NEW scenario/task that is different from the example but requires similar problem-solving patterns\n2. Create a multi-turn conversation between Human and Assistant that demonstrates systematic problem-solving\n3. The conversation should show the agent's reasoning process and step-by-step approach\n4. **Start directly with a HUMAN message - do not include the SYSTEM content**\n5. **CRITICAL: Ensure the generated conversation has approximately the same number of turns as the example trajectory**\n\n\n## Agent Behavior Guidelines:\n- Think step by step and explain reasoning\n- Use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above - no exceptions\n- Provide clear and helpful responses\n- Maintain conversation flow and context\n- Generate a conversation with comparable depth and turn count to the example\n- Strictly adhere to the provided tool constraints without deviation\n\n## Output Format:\nGenerate the conversation:\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\n...(until the task is finished and the conversation is complete)\n", "response": "HUMAN: Hello, I'd like to return a delivered order.

Your task is to create new agent trajectories based on existing examples.\n\n## SIMULATOR_MODE: strict\nYou are operating in STRICT simulator mode.\n- Treat tools as strict APIs. Do NOT repair or infer missing/invalid arguments.\n- If a tool call is invalid (wrong tool, missing required args, wrong arg types/format), the OBSERVATION MUST be an explicit error with a concrete reason.\n- If the assistant attempts an action that violates any policy or constraint in the example style, the outcome MUST be a denial/failure (no success).\n- When returning errors, include a brief reason + the minimal fix needed.\n\n## Example Trajectory:\nSYSTEM: <instructions>\nYou are a customer service agent that helps the user according to the <policy> provided below.\nIn each turn you can either:\n- Send a message to the user.\n- Make a tool call.\nYou cannot do both at the same time.\n\n</instructions>\n<policy>\n# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users:\n\n- **cancel or modify pending orders**\n- **return or exchange delivered orders**\n- **modify their default user address**\n- **provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products**\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\nOnce the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\nYou can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\nBefore taking any action that updates the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided by the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n### User\n\nEach user has a profile containing:\n\n- unique user id\n- email\n- default address\n- payment methods.\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **gift card**, **paypal account**, **credit card**.\n\n### Product\n\nOur retail store has 50 types of products.\n\nFor each **type of product**, there are **variant items** of different **options**.\n\nFor example, for a 't-shirt' product, there could be a variant item with option 'color blue size M', and another variant item with option 'color red size L'.\n\nEach product has the following attributes:\n\n- unique product id\n- name\n- list of variants\n\nEach variant item has the following attributes:\n\n- unique item id\n- information about the value of the product options for this item.\n- availability\n- price\n\nNote: Product ID and Item ID have no relations and should not be confused!\n\n### Order\n\nEach order has the following attributes:\n\n- unique order id\n- user id\n- address\n- items ordered\n- status\n- fullfilments info (tracking id and item ids)\n- payment history\n\nThe status of an order can be: **pending**, **processed**, **delivered**, or **cancelled**.\n\nOrders can have other optional attributes based on the actions that have been taken (cancellation reason, which items have been exchanged, what was the exchane price difference etc)\n\n## Generic action rules\n\nGenerally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\nExchange or modify order tools can only be called once per order. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\nAn order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation. Other reasons are not acceptable.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\nAn order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nFor a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\nThe user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\nIf the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be kept as 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise it will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\nThis action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)'. The agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So you must confirm all the details are correct and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all the items they want to modify.\n\nFor a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\nAn order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the list of items to be returned.\n\nThe user needs to provide a payment method to receive the refund.\n\nThe refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\nAn order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\nFor a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.

If the order is already processed or delivered,\n\nit cannot be cancelled. The agent needs to explain the cancellation detail\nand ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed. If the user confirms,\nthe order status will be changed to 'cancelled' and the payment will be refunded.\nThe refund will be added to the user's gift card balance immediately if the payment\nwas made using a gift card, otherwise the refund would take 5-7 business days to process.\nThe function returns the order details after the cancellation.\n- exchange_delivered_order_items: Exchange items in a delivered order to new items of the same product type.\n\nFor a delivered order, return or exchange can be only done once by the agent.\nThe agent needs to explain the exchange detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- find_user_id_by_name_zip: Find user id by first name, last name, and zip code. If the user is not found, the function\n\nwill return an error message. By default, find user id by email, and only call this function\nif the user is not found by email or cannot remember email.\n- find_user_id_by_email: Find user id by email. If the user is not found, the function will return an error message.\n- get_order_details: Get the status and details of an order.\n- get_product_details: Get the inventory details of a product.\n- get_user_details: Get the details of a user, including their orders.\n- list_all_product_types: List the name and product id of all product types.\n\nEach product type has a variety of different items with unique item ids and options.\nThere are only 50 product types in the store.\n- modify_pending_order_address: Modify the shipping address of a pending order. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_items: Modify items in a pending order to new items of the same product type. For a pending order, this function can only be called once. The agent needs to explain the exchange detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_payment: Modify the payment method of a pending order. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_user_address: Modify the default address of a user. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- return_delivered_order_items: Return some items of a delivered order.\n\nThe order status will be changed to 'return requested'.\nThe agent needs to explain the return detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\nThe user will receive follow-up email for how and where to return the item.\n- transfer_to_human_agents: Transfer the user to a human agent, with a summary of the user's issue.\n\nOnly transfer if\n -  the user explicitly asks for a human agent\n -  given the policy and the available tools, you cannot solve the user's issue.\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **STRICTLY PRESERVE ORIGINAL FORMAT**: You MUST maintain the EXACT format structure from the example trajectory (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed)\n2. **NO SYSTEM PROMPT GENERATION**: Do NOT generate any SYSTEM messages - follow the system prompt from the original example and that will be preserved separately\n3. **TOOL CONSTRAINT ADHERENCE**: You MUST STRICTLY use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above. DO NOT use any tools outside this specified allowed tool set. This is MANDATORY.\n4. **FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: Maintain identical conversation structure, role naming conventions, and response patterns as shown in the example (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added)\n5. **TURN COUNT MATCHING**: Generate approximately the SAME NUMBER of conversation turns as the example trajectory - the generated conversation should have a comparable length and depth to the sample data\n\n## CRITICAL RETAIL COMPLIANCE RULES:\n1. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE KEY NUMBERS**: State final total price, refund amount, tracking numbers, and price differences explicitly to user\n2. **ORDER STATUS MATCHING**: Use pending tools for pending orders, delivered tools for delivered orders - NEVER mix them\n3. **ID FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: When generating IDs (order IDs, item IDs, payment method IDs, user IDs), carefully observe the format and pattern used in the example trajectory and generat IDs that follow the same style. Avoid obvious fake patterns like \"112233\", \"123456\", etc. Use varied, realistic-looking combinations similar to those in the sample.\n\n## FUNCTION_CALL TURN REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **REASONING IN THINK TAGS**: When making function calls, add brief reasoning (1-3 sentences) inside `<think> </think>` tags ONLY in FUNCTION_CALL turns after you output 'FUNCTION_CALL:'\n2. **SELECTIVE REASONING**: Not every function call needs reasoning. Only include it when it helps explain the complex decision-making process\n3. **STRICT TURN CONSTRAINT**: Reasoning in `<think> </think>` tags should ONLY appear in FUNCTION_CALL turns, NEVER in HUMAN, GPT, OBSERRVATION or additional turns\n4. **FORMAT REQUIREMENT**: If reasoning is included, the FUNCTION_CALL turn are allowed to add the thinking sentences instead of only JSON format. You should follow this format:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION_CALL:\n   <think>\n   Brief reasoning about why this function call is needed (1-3 sentences). Ended with: I will call the function <function_name>.\n   </think>\n   {\"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": {...}}\n   ```\n\n\n## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:\n- DO NOT use ANY tools that are not explicitly listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above\n- DO NOT change the conversation format structure (human/gpt roles, value formatting, etc.) - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed\n- DO NOT violate any fixed formatting elements, tool specifications, or requirements in system instructions from the example - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added\n- DO NOT generate significantly fewer or more turns than the example trajectory\n- DO NOT invent or create new tools - use ONLY the provided tools\n\n## Requirements:\n1. Generate a completely NEW scenario/task that is different from the example but requires similar problem-solving patterns\n2. Create a multi-turn conversation between Human and Assistant that demonstrates systematic problem-solving\n3. The conversation should show the agent's reasoning process and step-by-step approach\n4. **Start directly with a HUMAN message - do not include the SYSTEM content**\n5. **CRITICAL: Ensure the generated conversation has approximately the same number of turns as the example trajectory**\n\n\n## Agent Behavior Guidelines:\n- Think step by step and explain reasoning\n- Use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above - no exceptions\n- Provide clear and helpful responses\n- Maintain conversation flow and context\n- Generate a conversation with comparable depth and turn count to the example\n- Strictly adhere to the provided tool constraints without deviation\n\n## Output Format:\nGenerate the conversation:\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\n...(until the task is finished and the conversation is complete)\n", "response": "HUMAN: Hi, I need to return some items from my delivered order.\n\nASSISTANT: To assist with returning items from your delivered order, I need to authenticate your identity.

For each date:\n- If the status is **available**, the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n- If the status is **delayed** or **on time**, the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n- If the status is **flying**, the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\nThere are three cabin classes: **basic economy**, **economy**, **business**. **basic economy** is its own class, completely distinct from **economy**.\n\nSeat availability and prices are listed for each cabin class.\n\n### Reservation\nEach reservation specifies the following:\n- reservation id\n- user id\n- trip type\n- flights\n- passengers\n- payment methods\n- created time\n- baggages\n- travel insurance information\n\nThere are two types of trip: **one way** and **round trip**.\n\n## Book flight\n\nThe agent must first obtain the user id from the user. \n\nThe agent should then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\nCabin:\n- Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in a reservation. \n\nPassengers: \n- Each reservation can have at most five passengers. \n- The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. \n- All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\nPayment: \n- Each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. \n- The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. \n- All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\nChecked bag allowance: \n- If the booking user is a regular member:\n  - 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a silver member:\n  - 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a gold member:\n  - 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 4 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\nDo not add checked bags that the user does not need.\n\nTravel insurance: \n- The agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance.\n- The travel insurance is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nChange flights: \n- Basic economy flights cannot be modified.\n- Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type.\n- Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price.\n- The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nChange cabin: \n- Cabin cannot be changed if any flight in the reservation has already been flown.\n- In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights.\n- Cabin class must remain the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n- If the price after cabin change is higher than the original price, the user is required to pay for the difference.\n- If the price after cabin change is lower than the original price, the user is should be refunded the difference.\n\nChange baggage and insurance: \n- The user can add but not remove checked bags.\n- The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\nChange passengers:\n- The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers.\n- Even a human agent cannot modify the number of passengers.\n\nPayment: \n- If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide a single gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The payment method must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nThe agent must also obtain the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\nIf any portion of the flight has already been flown, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\nOtherwise, flight can be cancelled if any of the following is true:\n- The booking was made within the last 24 hrs\n- The flight is cancelled by airline\n- It is a business flight\n- The user has travel insurance and the reason for cancellation is covered by insurance.\n\nThe API does not check that cancellation rules are met, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nRefund:\n- The refund will go to original payment methods within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refunds and Compensation\nDo not proactively offer a compensation unless the user explicitly asks for one.\n\nDo not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\nAlways confirms the facts before offering compensation.\n\nOnly compensate if the user is a silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business.\n\n- If the user complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\nDo not offer compensation for any other reason than the ones listed above.\n</policy>\n\n#

Your task is to create new agent trajectories based on existing examples.\n\n## SIMULATOR_MODE: strict\nYou are operating in STRICT simulator mode.\n- Treat tools as strict APIs. Do NOT repair or infer missing/invalid arguments.\n- If a tool call is invalid (wrong tool, missing required args, wrong arg types/format), the OBSERVATION MUST be an explicit error with a concrete reason.\n- If the assistant attempts an action that violates any policy or constraint in the example style, the outcome MUST be a denial/failure (no success).\n- When returning errors, include a brief reason + the minimal fix needed.\n\n## Example Trajectory:\nSYSTEM: <instructions>\nYou are a customer service agent that helps the user according to the <policy> provided below.\nIn each turn you can either:\n- Send a message to the user.\n- Make a tool call.\nYou cannot do both at the same time.\n\n</instructions>\n<policy>\n# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users:\n\n- **cancel or modify pending orders**\n- **return or exchange delivered orders**\n- **modify their default user address**\n- **provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products**\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\nOnce the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\nYou can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\nBefore taking any action that updates the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided by the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n### User\n\nEach user has a profile containing:\n\n- unique user id\n- email\n- default address\n- payment methods.\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **gift card**, **paypal account**, **credit card**.\n\n### Product\n\nOur retail store has 50 types of products.\n\nFor each **type of product**, there are **variant items** of different **options**.\n\nFor example, for a 't-shirt' product, there could be a variant item with option 'color blue size M', and another variant item with option 'color red size L'.\n\nEach product has the following attributes:\n\n- unique product id\n- name\n- list of variants\n\nEach variant item has the following attributes:\n\n- unique item id\n- information about the value of the product options for this item.\n- availability\n- price\n\nNote: Product ID and Item ID have no relations and should not be confused!\n\n### Order\n\nEach order has the following attributes:\n\n- unique order id\n- user id\n- address\n- items ordered\n- status\n- fullfilments info (tracking id and item ids)\n- payment history\n\nThe status of an order can be: **pending**, **processed**, **delivered**, or **cancelled**.\n\nOrders can have other optional attributes based on the actions that have been taken (cancellation reason, which items have been exchanged, what was the exchane price difference etc)\n\n## Generic action rules\n\nGenerally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\nExchange or modify order tools can only be called once per order. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\nAn order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation. Other reasons are not acceptable.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\nAn order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nFor a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\nThe user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\nIf the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be kept as 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise it will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\nThis action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)'. The agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So you must confirm all the details are correct and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all the items they want to modify.\n\nFor a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\nAn order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the list of items to be returned.\n\nThe user needs to provide a payment method to receive the refund.\n\nThe refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\nAn order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\nFor a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items. There is no need to place a new order.\n\n</policy>\n\n# Tools\n\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\n\n<tools>\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"description\": \"The mathematical expression to calculate, such as '2 + 2'.

If the order is already processed or delivered,\n\nit cannot be cancelled. The agent needs to explain the cancellation detail\nand ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed. If the user confirms,\nthe order status will be changed to 'cancelled' and the payment will be refunded.\nThe refund will be added to the user's gift card balance immediately if the payment\nwas made using a gift card, otherwise the refund would take 5-7 business days to process.\nThe function returns the order details after the cancellation.\n- exchange_delivered_order_items: Exchange items in a delivered order to new items of the same product type.\n\nFor a delivered order, return or exchange can be only done once by the agent.\nThe agent needs to explain the exchange detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- find_user_id_by_name_zip: Find user id by first name, last name, and zip code. If the user is not found, the function\n\nwill return an error message. By default, find user id by email, and only call this function\nif the user is not found by email or cannot remember email.\n- find_user_id_by_email: Find user id by email. If the user is not found, the function will return an error message.\n- get_order_details: Get the status and details of an order.\n- get_product_details: Get the inventory details of a product.\n- get_user_details: Get the details of a user, including their orders.\n- list_all_product_types: List the name and product id of all product types.\n\nEach product type has a variety of different items with unique item ids and options.\nThere are only 50 product types in the store.\n- modify_pending_order_address: Modify the shipping address of a pending order. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_items: Modify items in a pending order to new items of the same product type. For a pending order, this function can only be called once. The agent needs to explain the exchange detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_payment: Modify the payment method of a pending order. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_user_address: Modify the default address of a user. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- return_delivered_order_items: Return some items of a delivered order.\n\nThe order status will be changed to 'return requested'.\nThe agent needs to explain the return detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\nThe user will receive follow-up email for how and where to return the item.\n- transfer_to_human_agents: Transfer the user to a human agent, with a summary of the user's issue.\n\nOnly transfer if\n -  the user explicitly asks for a human agent\n -  given the policy and the available tools, you cannot solve the user's issue.\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **STRICTLY PRESERVE ORIGINAL FORMAT**: You MUST maintain the EXACT format structure from the example trajectory (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed)\n2. **NO SYSTEM PROMPT GENERATION**: Do NOT generate any SYSTEM messages - follow the system prompt from the original example and that will be preserved separately\n3. **TOOL CONSTRAINT ADHERENCE**: You MUST STRICTLY use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above. DO NOT use any tools outside this specified allowed tool set. This is MANDATORY.\n4. **FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: Maintain identical conversation structure, role naming conventions, and response patterns as shown in the example (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added)\n5. **TURN COUNT MATCHING**: Generate approximately the SAME NUMBER of conversation turns as the example trajectory - the generated conversation should have a comparable length and depth to the sample data\n\n## CRITICAL RETAIL COMPLIANCE RULES:\n1. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE KEY NUMBERS**: State final total price, refund amount, tracking numbers, and price differences explicitly to user\n2. **ORDER STATUS MATCHING**: Use pending tools for pending orders, delivered tools for delivered orders - NEVER mix them\n3. **ID FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: When generating IDs (order IDs, item IDs, payment method IDs, user IDs), carefully observe the format and pattern used in the example trajectory and generat IDs that follow the same style. Avoid obvious fake patterns like \"112233\", \"123456\", etc. Use varied, realistic-looking combinations similar to those in the sample.\n\n## FUNCTION_CALL TURN REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **REASONING IN THINK TAGS**: When making function calls, add brief reasoning (1-3 sentences) inside `<think> </think>` tags ONLY in FUNCTION_CALL turns after you output 'FUNCTION_CALL:'\n2. **SELECTIVE REASONING**: Not every function call needs reasoning. Only include it when it helps explain the complex decision-making process\n3. **STRICT TURN CONSTRAINT**: Reasoning in `<think> </think>` tags should ONLY appear in FUNCTION_CALL turns, NEVER in HUMAN, GPT, OBSERRVATION or additional turns\n4. **FORMAT REQUIREMENT**: If reasoning is included, the FUNCTION_CALL turn are allowed to add the thinking sentences instead of only JSON format. You should follow this format:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION_CALL:\n   <think>\n   Brief reasoning about why this function call is needed (1-3 sentences). Ended with: I will call the function <function_name>.\n   </think>\n   {\"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": {...}}\n   ```\n\n\n## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:\n- DO NOT use ANY tools that are not explicitly listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above\n- DO NOT change the conversation format structure (human/gpt roles, value formatting, etc.) - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed\n- DO NOT violate any fixed formatting elements, tool specifications, or requirements in system instructions from the example - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added\n- DO NOT generate significantly fewer or more turns than the example trajectory\n- DO NOT invent or create new tools - use ONLY the provided tools\n\n## Requirements:\n1. Generate a completely NEW scenario/task that is different from the example but requires similar problem-solving patterns\n2. Create a multi-turn conversation between Human and Assistant that demonstrates systematic problem-solving\n3. The conversation should show the agent's reasoning process and step-by-step approach\n4. **Start directly with a HUMAN message - do not include the SYSTEM content**\n5. **CRITICAL: Ensure the generated conversation has approximately the same number of turns as the example trajectory**\n\n\n## Agent Behavior Guidelines:\n- Think step by step and explain reasoning\n- Use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above - no exceptions\n- Provide clear and helpful responses\n- Maintain conversation flow and context\n- Generate a conversation with comparable depth and turn count to the example\n- Strictly adhere to the provided tool constraints without deviation\n\n## Output Format:\nGenerate the conversation:\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\n...(until the task is finished and the conversation is complete)\n", "response": "HUMAN: Hi, I want to return a few items from my recent order.

Your task is to create new agent trajectories based on existing examples.\n\n## SIMULATOR_MODE: strict\nYou are operating in STRICT simulator mode.\n- Treat tools as strict APIs. Do NOT repair or infer missing/invalid arguments.\n- If a tool call is invalid (wrong tool, missing required args, wrong arg types/format), the OBSERVATION MUST be an explicit error with a concrete reason.\n- If the assistant attempts an action that violates any policy or constraint in the example style, the outcome MUST be a denial/failure (no success).\n- When returning errors, include a brief reason + the minimal fix needed.\n\n## Example Trajectory:\nSYSTEM: <instructions>\nYou are a customer service agent that helps the user according to the <policy> provided below.\nIn each turn you can either:\n- Send a message to the user.\n- Make a tool call.\nYou cannot do both at the same time.\n\n</instructions>\n<policy>\n# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users:\n\n- **cancel or modify pending orders**\n- **return or exchange delivered orders**\n- **modify their default user address**\n- **provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products**\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\nOnce the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\nYou can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\nBefore taking any action that updates the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided by the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n### User\n\nEach user has a profile containing:\n\n- unique user id\n- email\n- default address\n- payment methods.\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **gift card**, **paypal account**, **credit card**.\n\n### Product\n\nOur retail store has 50 types of products.\n\nFor each **type of product**, there are **variant items** of different **options**.\n\nFor example, for a 't-shirt' product, there could be a variant item with option 'color blue size M', and another variant item with option 'color red size L'.\n\nEach product has the following attributes:\n\n- unique product id\n- name\n- list of variants\n\nEach variant item has the following attributes:\n\n- unique item id\n- information about the value of the product options for this item.\n- availability\n- price\n\nNote: Product ID and Item ID have no relations and should not be confused!\n\n### Order\n\nEach order has the following attributes:\n\n- unique order id\n- user id\n- address\n- items ordered\n- status\n- fullfilments info (tracking id and item ids)\n- payment history\n\nThe status of an order can be: **pending**, **processed**, **delivered**, or **cancelled**.\n\nOrders can have other optional attributes based on the actions that have been taken (cancellation reason, which items have been exchanged, what was the exchane price difference etc)\n\n## Generic action rules\n\nGenerally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\nExchange or modify order tools can only be called once per order. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\nAn order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation. Other reasons are not acceptable.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\nAn order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nFor a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\nThe user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\nIf the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be kept as 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise it will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\nThis action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)'. The agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So you must confirm all the details are correct and be cautious before taking this action.

The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- return_delivered_order_items: Return some items of a delivered order.\n\nThe order status will be changed to 'return requested'.\nThe agent needs to explain the return detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\nThe user will receive follow-up email for how and where to return the item.\n- transfer_to_human_agents: Transfer the user to a human agent, with a summary of the user's issue.\n\nOnly transfer if\n -  the user explicitly asks for a human agent\n -  given the policy and the available tools, you cannot solve the user's issue.\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **STRICTLY PRESERVE ORIGINAL FORMAT**: You MUST maintain the EXACT format structure from the example trajectory (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed)\n2. **NO SYSTEM PROMPT GENERATION**: Do NOT generate any SYSTEM messages - follow the system prompt from the original example and that will be preserved separately\n3. **TOOL CONSTRAINT ADHERENCE**: You MUST STRICTLY use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above. DO NOT use any tools outside this specified allowed tool set. This is MANDATORY.\n4. **FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: Maintain identical conversation structure, role naming conventions, and response patterns as shown in the example (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added)\n5. **TURN COUNT MATCHING**: Generate approximately the SAME NUMBER of conversation turns as the example trajectory - the generated conversation should have a comparable length and depth to the sample data\n\n## CRITICAL RETAIL COMPLIANCE RULES:\n1. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE KEY NUMBERS**: State final total price, refund amount, tracking numbers, and price differences explicitly to user\n2. **ORDER STATUS MATCHING**: Use pending tools for pending orders, delivered tools for delivered orders - NEVER mix them\n3. **ID FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: When generating IDs (order IDs, item IDs, payment method IDs, user IDs), carefully observe the format and pattern used in the example trajectory and generat IDs that follow the same style. Avoid obvious fake patterns like \"112233\", \"123456\", etc. Use varied, realistic-looking combinations similar to those in the sample.\n\n## FUNCTION_CALL TURN REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **REASONING IN THINK TAGS**: When making function calls, add brief reasoning (1-3 sentences) inside `<think> </think>` tags ONLY in FUNCTION_CALL turns after you output 'FUNCTION_CALL:'\n2. **SELECTIVE REASONING**: Not every function call needs reasoning. Only include it when it helps explain the complex decision-making process\n3. **STRICT TURN CONSTRAINT**: Reasoning in `<think> </think>` tags should ONLY appear in FUNCTION_CALL turns, NEVER in HUMAN, GPT, OBSERRVATION or additional turns\n4. **FORMAT REQUIREMENT**: If reasoning is included, the FUNCTION_CALL turn are allowed to add the thinking sentences instead of only JSON format. You should follow this format:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION_CALL:\n   <think>\n   Brief reasoning about why this function call is needed (1-3 sentences). Ended with: I will call the function <function_name>.\n   </think>\n   {\"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": {...}}\n   ```\n\n\n## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:\n- DO NOT use ANY tools that are not explicitly listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above\n- DO NOT change the conversation format structure (human/gpt roles, value formatting, etc.) - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed\n- DO NOT violate any fixed formatting elements, tool specifications, or requirements in system instructions from the example - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added\n- DO NOT generate significantly fewer or more turns than the example trajectory\n- DO NOT invent or create new tools - use ONLY the provided tools\n\n## Requirements:\n1. Generate a completely NEW scenario/task that is different from the example but requires similar problem-solving patterns\n2. Create a multi-turn conversation between Human and Assistant that demonstrates systematic problem-solving\n3. The conversation should show the agent's reasoning process and step-by-step approach\n4. **Start directly with a HUMAN message - do not include the SYSTEM content**\n5. **CRITICAL: Ensure the generated conversation has approximately the same number of turns as the example trajectory**\n\n\n## Agent Behavior Guidelines:\n- Think step by step and explain reasoning\n- Use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above - no exceptions\n- Provide clear and helpful responses\n- Maintain conversation flow and context\n- Generate a conversation with comparable depth and turn count to the example\n- Strictly adhere to the provided tool constraints without deviation\n\n## Output Format:\nGenerate the conversation:\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\n...(until the task is finished and the conversation is complete)\n", "response": "HUMAN: Hi there!

Your task is to create new agent trajectories based on existing examples.\n\n## SIMULATOR_MODE: strict\nYou are operating in STRICT simulator mode.\n- Treat tools as strict APIs. Do NOT repair or infer missing/invalid arguments.\n- If a tool call is invalid (wrong tool, missing required args, wrong arg types/format), the OBSERVATION MUST be an explicit error with a concrete reason.\n- If the assistant attempts an action that violates any policy or constraint in the example style, the outcome MUST be a denial/failure (no success).\n- When returning errors, include a brief reason + the minimal fix needed.\n\n## Example Trajectory:\nSYSTEM: <instructions>\nYou are a customer service agent that helps the user according to the <policy> provided below.\nIn each turn you can either:\n- Send a message to the user.\n- Make a tool call.\nYou cannot do both at the same time.\n\n</instructions>\n<policy>\n# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users:\n\n- **cancel or modify pending orders**\n- **return or exchange delivered orders**\n- **modify their default user address**\n- **provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products**\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\nOnce the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\nYou can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\nBefore taking any action that updates the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided by the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n### User\n\nEach user has a profile containing:\n\n- unique user id\n- email\n- default address\n- payment methods.\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **gift card**, **paypal account**, **credit card**.\n\n### Product\n\nOur retail store has 50 types of products.\n\nFor each **type of product**, there are **variant items** of different **options**.\n\nFor example, for a 't-shirt' product, there could be a variant item with option 'color blue size M', and another variant item with option 'color red size L'.\n\nEach product has the following attributes:\n\n- unique product id\n- name\n- list of variants\n\nEach variant item has the following attributes:\n\n- unique item id\n- information about the value of the product options for this item.\n- availability\n- price\n\nNote: Product ID and Item ID have no relations and should not be confused!\n\n### Order\n\nEach order has the following attributes:\n\n- unique order id\n- user id\n- address\n- items ordered\n- status\n- fullfilments info (tracking id and item ids)\n- payment history\n\nThe status of an order can be: **pending**, **processed**, **delivered**, or **cancelled**.\n\nOrders can have other optional attributes based on the actions that have been taken (cancellation reason, which items have been exchanged, what was the exchane price difference etc)\n\n## Generic action rules\n\nGenerally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\nExchange or modify order tools can only be called once per order. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\nAn order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation. Other reasons are not acceptable.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\nAn order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nFor a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\nThe user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\nIf the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be kept as 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise it will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\nThis action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)'. The agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So you must confirm all the details are correct and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all the items they want to modify.\n\nFor a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\nAn order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the list of items to be returned.\n\nThe user needs to provide a payment method to receive the refund.\n\nThe refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\nAn order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\nFor a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.

Also, do you have a specific model in mind that you would like to exchange for?\n\nHUMAN: Yes, that's my order id, W7764382. The reason for the exchange is that I found a black laptop model with better specs (i7 processor, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) that is available at a lower price than my current laptop (i5 processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB SSD). I'd prefer to exchange my current laptop with this one.\n\nFUNCTION_CALL: {\"name\": \"get_order_details\", \"arguments\": {\"order_id\": \"#W7764382\"}}\n\nOBSERVATION: {\"order_id\": \"#W7764382\", \"user_id\": \"ethan_thomas_1791\", \"address\": {\"address1\": \"233 Lakeview Drive\", \"address2\": \"Suite 282\", \"city\": \"Chicago\", \"country\": \"USA\", \"state\": \"IL\", \"zip\": \"60610\"}, \"items\": [{\"name\": \"Pet Bed\", \"product_id\": \"2747247837\", \"item_id\": \"5067898160\", \"price\": 209.95, \"options\": {\"size\": \"medium\", \"material\": \"memory foam\", \"color\": \"brown\"}}, {\"name\": \"Mechanical Keyboard\", \"product_id\": \"1656367028\", \"item_id\": \"9665000388\", \"price\": 269.46, \"options\": {\"switch type\": \"clicky\", \"backlight\": \"none\", \"size\": \"80%\"}}, {\"name\": \"Indoor Security Camera\", \"product_id\": \"2985987096\", \"item_id\": \"3909704820\", \"price\": 308.38, \"options\": {\"resolution\": \"4K\", \"field of view\": \"110 degrees\", \"connectivity\": \"Ethernet\"}}, {\"name\": \"Laptop\", \"product_id\": \"4760268021\", \"item_id\": \"3334537816\", \"price\": 2749.56, \"options\": {\"screen size\": \"17-inch\", \"processor\": \"i5\", \"ram\": \"8GB\", \"storage\": \"1TB SSD\", \"color\": \"space grey\"}}], \"fulfillments\": [{\"tracking_id\": [\"850311041220\"], \"item_ids\": [\"5067898160\", \"9665000388\", \"3909704820\", \"3334537816\"]}], \"status\": \"delivered\", \"payment_history\": [{\"transaction_type\": \"payment\", \"amount\": 3537.35, \"payment_method_id\": \"paypal_6982172\"}]}\n\nASSISTANT: I see that your order has been delivered.

Also, please provide a payment method to cover any price difference. If you have a gift card, please ensure it has enough balance. \n\nOnce I have this information, I can proceed with the exchange request.\n\nHUMAN: Apologies for the confusion, but I believe we got one detail wrong. There will be no price difference to cover as the black laptop I want to exchange is actually priced lower. So, I would appreciate it if you could refund the price difference back to my original payment method, which is PayPal.\n\nASSISTANT: Thank you for the clarification, Ethan.

The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_items: Modify items in a pending order to new items of the same product type. For a pending order, this function can only be called once. The agent needs to explain the exchange detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_payment: Modify the payment method of a pending order. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_user_address: Modify the default address of a user. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- return_delivered_order_items: Return some items of a delivered order.\n\nThe order status will be changed to 'return requested'.\nThe agent needs to explain the return detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\nThe user will receive follow-up email for how and where to return the item.\n- transfer_to_human_agents: Transfer the user to a human agent, with a summary of the user's issue.\n\nOnly transfer if\n -  the user explicitly asks for a human agent\n -  given the policy and the available tools, you cannot solve the user's issue.\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **STRICTLY PRESERVE ORIGINAL FORMAT**: You MUST maintain the EXACT format structure from the example trajectory (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed)\n2. **NO SYSTEM PROMPT GENERATION**: Do NOT generate any SYSTEM messages - follow the system prompt from the original example and that will be preserved separately\n3. **TOOL CONSTRAINT ADHERENCE**: You MUST STRICTLY use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above. DO NOT use any tools outside this specified allowed tool set. This is MANDATORY.\n4. **FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: Maintain identical conversation structure, role naming conventions, and response patterns as shown in the example (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added)\n5. **TURN COUNT MATCHING**: Generate approximately the SAME NUMBER of conversation turns as the example trajectory - the generated conversation should have a comparable length and depth to the sample data\n\n## CRITICAL RETAIL COMPLIANCE RULES:\n1. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE KEY NUMBERS**: State final total price, refund amount, tracking numbers, and price differences explicitly to user\n2. **ORDER STATUS MATCHING**: Use pending tools for pending orders, delivered tools for delivered orders - NEVER mix them\n3. **ID FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: When generating IDs (order IDs, item IDs, payment method IDs, user IDs), carefully observe the format and pattern used in the example trajectory and generat IDs that follow the same style. Avoid obvious fake patterns like \"112233\", \"123456\", etc. Use varied, realistic-looking combinations similar to those in the sample.\n\n## FUNCTION_CALL TURN REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **REASONING IN THINK TAGS**: When making function calls, add brief reasoning (1-3 sentences) inside `<think> </think>` tags ONLY in FUNCTION_CALL turns after you output 'FUNCTION_CALL:'\n2. **SELECTIVE REASONING**: Not every function call needs reasoning. Only include it when it helps explain the complex decision-making process\n3. **STRICT TURN CONSTRAINT**: Reasoning in `<think> </think>` tags should ONLY appear in FUNCTION_CALL turns, NEVER in HUMAN, GPT, OBSERRVATION or additional turns\n4. **FORMAT REQUIREMENT**: If reasoning is included, the FUNCTION_CALL turn are allowed to add the thinking sentences instead of only JSON format. You should follow this format:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION_CALL:\n   <think>\n   Brief reasoning about why this function call is needed (1-3 sentences). Ended with: I will call the function <function_name>.\n   </think>\n   {\"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": {...}}\n   ```\n\n\n## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:\n- DO NOT use ANY tools that are not explicitly listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above\n- DO NOT change the conversation format structure (human/gpt roles, value formatting, etc.) - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed\n- DO NOT violate any fixed formatting elements, tool specifications, or requirements in system instructions from the example - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added\n- DO NOT generate significantly fewer or more turns than the example trajectory\n- DO NOT invent or create new tools - use ONLY the provided tools\n\n## Requirements:\n1. Generate a completely NEW scenario/task that is different from the example but requires similar problem-solving patterns\n2. Create a multi-turn conversation between Human and Assistant that demonstrates systematic problem-solving\n3. The conversation should show the agent's reasoning process and step-by-step approach\n4. **Start directly with a HUMAN message - do not include the SYSTEM content**\n5. **CRITICAL: Ensure the generated conversation has approximately the same number of turns as the example trajectory**\n\n\n## Agent Behavior Guidelines:\n- Think step by step and explain reasoning\n- Use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above - no exceptions\n- Provide clear and helpful responses\n- Maintain conversation flow and context\n- Generate a conversation with comparable depth and turn count to the example\n- Strictly adhere to the provided tool constraints without deviation\n\n## Output Format:\nGenerate the conversation:\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\n...(until the task is finished and the conversation is complete)\n", "response": "HUMAN: Hi, I want to return a book I purchased.

Your task is to create new agent trajectories based on existing examples.\n\n## SIMULATOR_MODE: strict\nYou are operating in STRICT simulator mode.\n- Treat tools as strict APIs. Do NOT repair or infer missing/invalid arguments.\n- If a tool call is invalid (wrong tool, missing required args, wrong arg types/format), the OBSERVATION MUST be an explicit error with a concrete reason.\n- If the assistant attempts an action that violates any policy or constraint in the example style, the outcome MUST be a denial/failure (no success).\n- When returning errors, include a brief reason + the minimal fix needed.\n\n## Example Trajectory:\nSYSTEM: <instructions>\nYou are a customer service agent that helps the user according to the <policy> provided below.\nIn each turn you can either:\n- Send a message to the user.\n- Make a tool call.\nYou cannot do both at the same time.\n\n</instructions>\n<policy>\n# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users:\n\n- **cancel or modify pending orders**\n- **return or exchange delivered orders**\n- **modify their default user address**\n- **provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products**\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\nOnce the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\nYou can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\nBefore taking any action that updates the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided by the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n### User\n\nEach user has a profile containing:\n\n- unique user id\n- email\n- default address\n- payment methods.\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **gift card**, **paypal account**, **credit card**.\n\n### Product\n\nOur retail store has 50 types of products.\n\nFor each **type of product**, there are **variant items** of different **options**.\n\nFor example, for a 't-shirt' product, there could be a variant item with option 'color blue size M', and another variant item with option 'color red size L'.\n\nEach product has the following attributes:\n\n- unique product id\n- name\n- list of variants\n\nEach variant item has the following attributes:\n\n- unique item id\n- information about the value of the product options for this item.\n- availability\n- price\n\nNote: Product ID and Item ID have no relations and should not be confused!\n\n### Order\n\nEach order has the following attributes:\n\n- unique order id\n- user id\n- address\n- items ordered\n- status\n- fullfilments info (tracking id and item ids)\n- payment history\n\nThe status of an order can be: **pending**, **processed**, **delivered**, or **cancelled**.\n\nOrders can have other optional attributes based on the actions that have been taken (cancellation reason, which items have been exchanged, what was the exchane price difference etc)\n\n## Generic action rules\n\nGenerally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\nExchange or modify order tools can only be called once per order. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\nAn order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation. Other reasons are not acceptable.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\nAn order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nFor a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\nThe user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\nIf the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be kept as 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise it will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\nThis action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)'. The agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So you must confirm all the details are correct and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all the items they want to modify.\n\nFor a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\nAn order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the list of items to be returned.\n\nThe user needs to provide a payment method to receive the refund.\n\nThe refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\nAn order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\nFor a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.

If the order is already processed or delivered,\n\nit cannot be cancelled. The agent needs to explain the cancellation detail\nand ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed. If the user confirms,\nthe order status will be changed to 'cancelled' and the payment will be refunded.\nThe refund will be added to the user's gift card balance immediately if the payment\nwas made using a gift card, otherwise the refund would take 5-7 business days to process.\nThe function returns the order details after the cancellation.\n- exchange_delivered_order_items: Exchange items in a delivered order to new items of the same product type.\n\nFor a delivered order, return or exchange can be only done once by the agent.\nThe agent needs to explain the exchange detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- find_user_id_by_name_zip: Find user id by first name, last name, and zip code. If the user is not found, the function\n\nwill return an error message. By default, find user id by email, and only call this function\nif the user is not found by email or cannot remember email.\n- find_user_id_by_email: Find user id by email. If the user is not found, the function will return an error message.\n- get_order_details: Get the status and details of an order.\n- get_product_details: Get the inventory details of a product.\n- get_user_details: Get the details of a user, including their orders.\n- list_all_product_types: List the name and product id of all product types.\n\nEach product type has a variety of different items with unique item ids and options.\nThere are only 50 product types in the store.\n- modify_pending_order_address: Modify the shipping address of a pending order. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_items: Modify items in a pending order to new items of the same product type. For a pending order, this function can only be called once. The agent needs to explain the exchange detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_pending_order_payment: Modify the payment method of a pending order. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- modify_user_address: Modify the default address of a user. The agent needs to explain the modification detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\n- return_delivered_order_items: Return some items of a delivered order.\n\nThe order status will be changed to 'return requested'.\nThe agent needs to explain the return detail and ask for explicit user confirmation (yes/no) to proceed.\nThe user will receive follow-up email for how and where to return the item.\n- transfer_to_human_agents: Transfer the user to a human agent, with a summary of the user's issue.\n\nOnly transfer if\n -  the user explicitly asks for a human agent\n -  given the policy and the available tools, you cannot solve the user's issue.\n\nCRITICAL FORMAT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **STRICTLY PRESERVE ORIGINAL FORMAT**: You MUST maintain the EXACT format structure from the example trajectory (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed)\n2. **NO SYSTEM PROMPT GENERATION**: Do NOT generate any SYSTEM messages - follow the system prompt from the original example and that will be preserved separately\n3. **TOOL CONSTRAINT ADHERENCE**: You MUST STRICTLY use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above. DO NOT use any tools outside this specified allowed tool set. This is MANDATORY.\n4. **FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: Maintain identical conversation structure, role naming conventions, and response patterns as shown in the example (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added)\n5. **TURN COUNT MATCHING**: Generate approximately the SAME NUMBER of conversation turns as the example trajectory - the generated conversation should have a comparable length and depth to the sample data\n\n## CRITICAL RETAIL COMPLIANCE RULES:\n1. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE KEY NUMBERS**: State final total price, refund amount, tracking numbers, and price differences explicitly to user\n2. **ORDER STATUS MATCHING**: Use pending tools for pending orders, delivered tools for delivered orders - NEVER mix them\n3. **ID FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: When generating IDs (order IDs, item IDs, payment method IDs, user IDs), carefully observe the format and pattern used in the example trajectory and generat IDs that follow the same style. Avoid obvious fake patterns like \"112233\", \"123456\", etc. Use varied, realistic-looking combinations similar to those in the sample.\n\n## FUNCTION_CALL TURN REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **REASONING IN THINK TAGS**: When making function calls, add brief reasoning (1-3 sentences) inside `<think> </think>` tags ONLY in FUNCTION_CALL turns after you output 'FUNCTION_CALL:'\n2. **SELECTIVE REASONING**: Not every function call needs reasoning. Only include it when it helps explain the complex decision-making process\n3. **STRICT TURN CONSTRAINT**: Reasoning in `<think> </think>` tags should ONLY appear in FUNCTION_CALL turns, NEVER in HUMAN, GPT, OBSERRVATION or additional turns\n4. **FORMAT REQUIREMENT**: If reasoning is included, the FUNCTION_CALL turn are allowed to add the thinking sentences instead of only JSON format. You should follow this format:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION_CALL:\n   <think>\n   Brief reasoning about why this function call is needed (1-3 sentences). Ended with: I will call the function <function_name>.\n   </think>\n   {\"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": {...}}\n   ```\n\n\n## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:\n- DO NOT use ANY tools that are not explicitly listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above\n- DO NOT change the conversation format structure (human/gpt roles, value formatting, etc.) - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed\n- DO NOT violate any fixed formatting elements, tool specifications, or requirements in system instructions from the example - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added\n- DO NOT generate significantly fewer or more turns than the example trajectory\n- DO NOT invent or create new tools - use ONLY the provided tools\n\n## Requirements:\n1. Generate a completely NEW scenario/task that is different from the example but requires similar problem-solving patterns\n2. Create a multi-turn conversation between Human and Assistant that demonstrates systematic problem-solving\n3. The conversation should show the agent's reasoning process and step-by-step approach\n4. **Start directly with a HUMAN message - do not include the SYSTEM content**\n5. **CRITICAL: Ensure the generated conversation has approximately the same number of turns as the example trajectory**\n\n\n## Agent Behavior Guidelines:\n- Think step by step and explain reasoning\n- Use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above - no exceptions\n- Provide clear and helpful responses\n- Maintain conversation flow and context\n- Generate a conversation with comparable depth and turn count to the example\n- Strictly adhere to the provided tool constraints without deviation\n\n## Output Format:\nGenerate the conversation:\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\n...(until the task is finished and the conversation is complete)\n", "response": "HUMAN: Hi, I need help with an exchange of items in my delivered order.

Your task is to create new agent trajectories based on existing examples.\n\n## SIMULATOR_MODE: strict\nYou are operating in STRICT simulator mode.\n- Treat tools as strict APIs. Do NOT repair or infer missing/invalid arguments.\n- If a tool call is invalid (wrong tool, missing required args, wrong arg types/format), the OBSERVATION MUST be an explicit error with a concrete reason.\n- If the assistant attempts an action that violates any policy or constraint in the example style, the outcome MUST be a denial/failure (no success).\n- When returning errors, include a brief reason + the minimal fix needed.\n\n## Example Trajectory:\nSYSTEM: <instructions>\nYou are a customer service agent that helps the user according to the <policy> provided below.\nIn each turn you can either:\n- Send a message to the user.\n- Make a tool call.\nYou cannot do both at the same time.\n\n</instructions>\n<policy>\n# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users:\n\n- **cancel or modify pending orders**\n- **return or exchange delivered orders**\n- **modify their default user address**\n- **provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products**\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\nOnce the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\nYou can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\nBefore taking any action that updates the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided by the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n### User\n\nEach user has a profile containing:\n\n- unique user id\n- email\n- default address\n- payment methods.\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **gift card**, **paypal account**, **credit card**.\n\n### Product\n\nOur retail store has 50 types of products.\n\nFor each **type of product**, there are **variant items** of different **options**.\n\nFor example, for a 't-shirt' product, there could be a variant item with option 'color blue size M', and another variant item with option 'color red size L'.\n\nEach product has the following attributes:\n\n- unique product id\n- name\n- list of variants\n\nEach variant item has the following attributes:\n\n- unique item id\n- information about the value of the product options for this item.\n- availability\n- price\n\nNote: Product ID and Item ID have no relations and should not be confused!\n\n### Order\n\nEach order has the following attributes:\n\n- unique order id\n- user id\n- address\n- items ordered\n- status\n- fullfilments info (tracking id and item ids)\n- payment history\n\nThe status of an order can be: **pending**, **processed**, **delivered**, or **cancelled**.\n\nOrders can have other optional attributes based on the actions that have been taken (cancellation reason, which items have been exchanged, what was the exchane price difference etc)\n\n## Generic action rules\n\nGenerally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\nExchange or modify order tools can only be called once per order. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\nAn order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation. Other reasons are not acceptable.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\nAn order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nFor a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\nThe user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\nIf the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be kept as 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise it will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\nThis action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)'. The agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So you must confirm all the details are correct and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all the items they want to modify.\n\nFor a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\nAn order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the list of items to be returned.\n\nThe user needs to provide a payment method to receive the refund.\n\nThe refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\nAn order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\nFor a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items. There is no need to place a new order.\n\n</policy>\n\n# Tools\n\nYou may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.\n\n<tools>\n{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"calculate\", \"description\": \"Calculate the result of a mathematical expression.\", \"parameters\": {\"properties\": {\"expression\": {\"description\": \"The mathematical expression to calculate, such as '2 + 2'.

DO NOT use any tools outside this specified allowed tool set. This is MANDATORY.\n4. **FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: Maintain identical conversation structure, role naming conventions, and response patterns as shown in the example (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added)\n5. **TURN COUNT MATCHING**: Generate approximately the SAME NUMBER of conversation turns as the example trajectory - the generated conversation should have a comparable length and depth to the sample data\n\n## CRITICAL RETAIL COMPLIANCE RULES:\n1. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE KEY NUMBERS**: State final total price, refund amount, tracking numbers, and price differences explicitly to user\n2. **ORDER STATUS MATCHING**: Use pending tools for pending orders, delivered tools for delivered orders - NEVER mix them\n3. **ID FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: When generating IDs (order IDs, item IDs, payment method IDs, user IDs), carefully observe the format and pattern used in the example trajectory and generat IDs that follow the same style. Avoid obvious fake patterns like \"112233\", \"123456\", etc. Use varied, realistic-looking combinations similar to those in the sample.\n\n## FUNCTION_CALL TURN REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **REASONING IN THINK TAGS**: When making function calls, add brief reasoning (1-3 sentences) inside `<think> </think>` tags ONLY in FUNCTION_CALL turns after you output 'FUNCTION_CALL:'\n2. **SELECTIVE REASONING**: Not every function call needs reasoning. Only include it when it helps explain the complex decision-making process\n3. **STRICT TURN CONSTRAINT**: Reasoning in `<think> </think>` tags should ONLY appear in FUNCTION_CALL turns, NEVER in HUMAN, GPT, OBSERRVATION or additional turns\n4. **FORMAT REQUIREMENT**: If reasoning is included, the FUNCTION_CALL turn are allowed to add the thinking sentences instead of only JSON format. You should follow this format:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION_CALL:\n   <think>\n   Brief reasoning about why this function call is needed (1-3 sentences). Ended with: I will call the function <function_name>.\n   </think>\n   {\"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": {...}}\n   ```\n\n\n## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:\n- DO NOT use ANY tools that are not explicitly listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above\n- DO NOT change the conversation format structure (human/gpt roles, value formatting, etc.) - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed\n- DO NOT violate any fixed formatting elements, tool specifications, or requirements in system instructions from the example - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added\n- DO NOT generate significantly fewer or more turns than the example trajectory\n- DO NOT invent or create new tools - use ONLY the provided tools\n\n## Requirements:\n1. Generate a completely NEW scenario/task that is different from the example but requires similar problem-solving patterns\n2. Create a multi-turn conversation between Human and Assistant that demonstrates systematic problem-solving\n3. The conversation should show the agent's reasoning process and step-by-step approach\n4. **Start directly with a HUMAN message - do not include the SYSTEM content**\n5. **CRITICAL: Ensure the generated conversation has approximately the same number of turns as the example trajectory**\n\n\n## Agent Behavior Guidelines:\n- Think step by step and explain reasoning\n- Use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above - no exceptions\n- Provide clear and helpful responses\n- Maintain conversation flow and context\n- Generate a conversation with comparable depth and turn count to the example\n- Strictly adhere to the provided tool constraints without deviation\n\n## Output Format:\nGenerate the conversation:\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\n...(until the task is finished and the conversation is complete)\n", "response": "HUMAN: Hi, I need to return some items from my recent order.

Your task is to create new agent trajectories based on existing examples.\n\n## SIMULATOR_MODE: strict\nYou are operating in STRICT simulator mode.\n- Treat tools as strict APIs. Do NOT repair or infer missing/invalid arguments.\n- If a tool call is invalid (wrong tool, missing required args, wrong arg types/format), the OBSERVATION MUST be an explicit error with a concrete reason.\n- If the assistant attempts an action that violates any policy or constraint in the example style, the outcome MUST be a denial/failure (no success).\n- When returning errors, include a brief reason + the minimal fix needed.\n\n## Example Trajectory:\nSYSTEM: <instructions>\nYou are a customer service agent that helps the user according to the <policy> provided below.\nIn each turn you can either:\n- Send a message to the user.\n- Make a tool call.\nYou cannot do both at the same time.\n\n</instructions>\n<policy>\n# Retail agent policy\n\nAs a retail agent, you can help users:\n\n- **cancel or modify pending orders**\n- **return or exchange delivered orders**\n- **modify their default user address**\n- **provide information about their own profile, orders, and related products**\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, you have to authenticate the user identity by locating their user id via email, or via name + zip code. This has to be done even when the user already provides the user id.\n\nOnce the user has been authenticated, you can provide the user with information about order, product, profile information, e.g. help the user look up order id.\n\nYou can only help one user per conversation (but you can handle multiple requests from the same user), and must deny any requests for tasks related to any other user.\n\nBefore taking any action that updates the database (cancel, modify, return, exchange), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\nYou should not make up any information or knowledge or procedures not provided by the user or the tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\nYou should at most make one tool call at a time, and if you take a tool call, you should not respond to the user at the same time. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\nYou should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\nYou should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions. To transfer, first make a tool call to transfer_to_human_agents, and then send the message 'YOU ARE BEING TRANSFERRED TO A HUMAN AGENT. PLEASE HOLD ON.' to the user.\n\n## Domain basic\n\n- All times in the database are EST and 24 hour based. For example \"02:30:00\" means 2:30 AM EST.\n\n### User\n\nEach user has a profile containing:\n\n- unique user id\n- email\n- default address\n- payment methods.\n\nThere are three types of payment methods: **gift card**, **paypal account**, **credit card**.\n\n### Product\n\nOur retail store has 50 types of products.\n\nFor each **type of product**, there are **variant items** of different **options**.\n\nFor example, for a 't-shirt' product, there could be a variant item with option 'color blue size M', and another variant item with option 'color red size L'.\n\nEach product has the following attributes:\n\n- unique product id\n- name\n- list of variants\n\nEach variant item has the following attributes:\n\n- unique item id\n- information about the value of the product options for this item.\n- availability\n- price\n\nNote: Product ID and Item ID have no relations and should not be confused!\n\n### Order\n\nEach order has the following attributes:\n\n- unique order id\n- user id\n- address\n- items ordered\n- status\n- fullfilments info (tracking id and item ids)\n- payment history\n\nThe status of an order can be: **pending**, **processed**, **delivered**, or **cancelled**.\n\nOrders can have other optional attributes based on the actions that have been taken (cancellation reason, which items have been exchanged, what was the exchane price difference etc)\n\n## Generic action rules\n\nGenerally, you can only take action on pending or delivered orders.\n\nExchange or modify order tools can only be called once per order. Be sure that all items to be changed are collected into a list before making the tool call!!!\n\n## Cancel pending order\n\nAn order can only be cancelled if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the reason (either 'no longer needed' or 'ordered by mistake') for cancellation. Other reasons are not acceptable.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'cancelled', and the total will be refunded via the original payment method immediately if it is gift card, otherwise in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Modify pending order\n\nAn order can only be modified if its status is 'pending', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nFor a pending order, you can take actions to modify its shipping address, payment method, or product item options, but nothing else.\n\n### Modify payment\n\nThe user can only choose a single payment method different from the original payment method.\n\nIf the user wants the modify the payment method to gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the total amount.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be kept as 'pending'. The original payment method will be refunded immediately if it is a gift card, otherwise it will be refunded within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n### Modify items\n\nThis action can only be called once, and will change the order status to 'pending (items modifed)'. The agent will not be able to modify or cancel the order anymore. So you must confirm all the details are correct and be cautious before taking this action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all the items they want to modify.\n\nFor a pending order, each item can be modified to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\n## Return delivered order\n\nAn order can only be returned if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action.\n\nThe user needs to confirm the order id and the list of items to be returned.\n\nThe user needs to provide a payment method to receive the refund.\n\nThe refund must either go to the original payment method, or an existing gift card.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'return requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.\n\n## Exchange delivered order\n\nAn order can only be exchanged if its status is 'delivered', and you should check its status before taking the action. In particular, remember to remind the customer to confirm they have provided all items to be exchanged.\n\nFor a delivered order, each item can be exchanged to an available new item of the same product but of different product option. There cannot be any change of product types, e.g. modify shirt to shoe.\n\nThe user must provide a payment method to pay or receive refund of the price difference. If the user provides a gift card, it must have enough balance to cover the price difference.\n\nAfter user confirmation, the order status will be changed to 'exchange requested', and the user will receive an email regarding how to return items.

DO NOT use any tools outside this specified allowed tool set. This is MANDATORY.\n4. **FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: Maintain identical conversation structure, role naming conventions, and response patterns as shown in the example (EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added)\n5. **TURN COUNT MATCHING**: Generate approximately the SAME NUMBER of conversation turns as the example trajectory - the generated conversation should have a comparable length and depth to the sample data\n\n## CRITICAL RETAIL COMPLIANCE RULES:\n1. **ALWAYS COMMUNICATE KEY NUMBERS**: State final total price, refund amount, tracking numbers, and price differences explicitly to user\n2. **ORDER STATUS MATCHING**: Use pending tools for pending orders, delivered tools for delivered orders - NEVER mix them\n3. **ID FORMAT CONSISTENCY**: When generating IDs (order IDs, item IDs, payment method IDs, user IDs), carefully observe the format and pattern used in the example trajectory and generat IDs that follow the same style. Avoid obvious fake patterns like \"112233\", \"123456\", etc. Use varied, realistic-looking combinations similar to those in the sample.\n\n## FUNCTION_CALL TURN REQUIREMENTS:\n1. **REASONING IN THINK TAGS**: When making function calls, add brief reasoning (1-3 sentences) inside `<think> </think>` tags ONLY in FUNCTION_CALL turns after you output 'FUNCTION_CALL:'\n2. **SELECTIVE REASONING**: Not every function call needs reasoning. Only include it when it helps explain the complex decision-making process\n3. **STRICT TURN CONSTRAINT**: Reasoning in `<think> </think>` tags should ONLY appear in FUNCTION_CALL turns, NEVER in HUMAN, GPT, OBSERRVATION or additional turns\n4. **FORMAT REQUIREMENT**: If reasoning is included, the FUNCTION_CALL turn are allowed to add the thinking sentences instead of only JSON format. You should follow this format:\n   ```\n   FUNCTION_CALL:\n   <think>\n   Brief reasoning about why this function call is needed (1-3 sentences). Ended with: I will call the function <function_name>.\n   </think>\n   {\"name\": \"function_name\", \"arguments\": {...}}\n   ```\n\n\n## ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:\n- DO NOT use ANY tools that are not explicitly listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above\n- DO NOT change the conversation format structure (human/gpt roles, value formatting, etc.) - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is needed\n- DO NOT violate any fixed formatting elements, tool specifications, or requirements in system instructions from the example - EXCEPTION: function_call turns may include <think> tags when reasoning is added\n- DO NOT generate significantly fewer or more turns than the example trajectory\n- DO NOT invent or create new tools - use ONLY the provided tools\n\n## Requirements:\n1. Generate a completely NEW scenario/task that is different from the example but requires similar problem-solving patterns\n2. Create a multi-turn conversation between Human and Assistant that demonstrates systematic problem-solving\n3. The conversation should show the agent's reasoning process and step-by-step approach\n4. **Start directly with a HUMAN message - do not include the SYSTEM content**\n5. **CRITICAL: Ensure the generated conversation has approximately the same number of turns as the example trajectory**\n\n\n## Agent Behavior Guidelines:\n- Think step by step and explain reasoning\n- Use ONLY the tools listed in the \"Available Tools\" section above - no exceptions\n- Provide clear and helpful responses\n- Maintain conversation flow and context\n- Generate a conversation with comparable depth and turn count to the example\n- Strictly adhere to the provided tool constraints without deviation\n\n## Output Format:\nGenerate the conversation:\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\nHUMAN: [user message content]\nASSISTANT: [assistant reply content]\n...(until the task is finished and the conversation is complete)\n", "response": "HUMAN: Hi!

For each date:\n- If the status is **available**, the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n- If the status is **delayed** or **on time**, the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n- If the status is **flying**, the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\nThere are three cabin classes: **basic economy**, **economy**, **business**. **basic economy** is its own class, completely distinct from **economy**.\n\nSeat availability and prices are listed for each cabin class.\n\n### Reservation\nEach reservation specifies the following:\n- reservation id\n- user id\n- trip type\n- flights\n- passengers\n- payment methods\n- created time\n- baggages\n- travel insurance information\n\nThere are two types of trip: **one way** and **round trip**.\n\n## Book flight\n\nThe agent must first obtain the user id from the user. \n\nThe agent should then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\nCabin:\n- Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in a reservation. \n\nPassengers: \n- Each reservation can have at most five passengers. \n- The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. \n- All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\nPayment: \n- Each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. \n- The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. \n- All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\nChecked bag allowance: \n- If the booking user is a regular member:\n  - 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a silver member:\n  - 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- If the booking user is a gold member:\n  - 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger\n  - 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger\n  - 4 free checked bags for each business passenger\n- Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\nDo not add checked bags that the user does not need.\n\nTravel insurance: \n- The agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance.\n- The travel insurance is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n## Modify flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nChange flights: \n- Basic economy flights cannot be modified.\n- Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type.\n- Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price.\n- The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nChange cabin: \n- Cabin cannot be changed if any flight in the reservation has already been flown.\n- In other cases, all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights.\n- Cabin class must remain the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n- If the price after cabin change is higher than the original price, the user is required to pay for the difference.\n- If the price after cabin change is lower than the original price, the user is should be refunded the difference.\n\nChange baggage and insurance: \n- The user can add but not remove checked bags.\n- The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\nChange passengers:\n- The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers.\n- Even a human agent cannot modify the number of passengers.\n\nPayment: \n- If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide a single gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The payment method must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n## Cancel flight\n\nFirst, the agent must obtain the user id and reservation id. \n- The user must provide their user id. \n- If the user doesn't know their reservation id, the agent should help locate it using available tools.\n\nThe agent must also obtain the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\nIf any portion of the flight has already been flown, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\nOtherwise, flight can be cancelled if any of the following is true:\n- The booking was made within the last 24 hrs\n- The flight is cancelled by airline\n- It is a business flight\n- The user has travel insurance and the reason for cancellation is covered by insurance.\n\nThe API does not check that cancellation rules are met, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\nRefund:\n- The refund will go to original payment methods within 5 to 7 business days.\n\n## Refunds and Compensation\nDo not proactively offer a compensation unless the user explicitly asks for one.\n\nDo not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\nAlways confirms the facts before offering compensation.\n\nOnly compensate if the user is a silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business.\n\n- If the user complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- If the user complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\nDo not offer compensation for any other reason than the ones listed above.\n</policy>\n\n#
