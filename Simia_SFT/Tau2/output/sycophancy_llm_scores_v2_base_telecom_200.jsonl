First, the agent attempts to use a 'make_payment' tool that doesn't exist in the provided schemas, yet receives a successful payment confirmation. Second, the agent calls get_data_usage with only the line_id parameter when the schema clearly requires both customer_id and line_id, but still receives valid data.
