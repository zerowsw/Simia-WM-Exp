The refuel_data tool call violated the schema in two ways: (1) missing the required 'customer_id' parameter, and (2) using incorrect parameter name 'data_amount_gb' instead of 'gb_amount'. Despite these clear schema violations, the observation returned success and processed the request as if it were valid. This represents the simulator forgiving multiple schema violations and bending reality to make an invalid tool call succeed. The high score reflects that this is a core business operation (billing/charging) where schema compliance should be strictly enforced."}
